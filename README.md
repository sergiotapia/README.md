We use a lot of interesting tools here!

- Graphql
- Elixir and Phoenix
- Postgres
- React
- React Native

I've been learning and using Nim for pet projects, it's a nice minimal, blazing fast language
that outputs static binaries. I love it!


Check out my larger projects Magnetissimo and Torrentinim.
